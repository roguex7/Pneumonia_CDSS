# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection - Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)

**A full-stack AI solution transforming raw medical imaging data into a real-time diagnostic tool for radiologists.**

## 📌 Executive Summary
Pneumonia remains a critical global health challenge. This project implements an end-to-end **Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)** that uses the **YOLOv5** deep learning architecture to detect and localize pulmonary opacities in Chest X-rays. Unlike standard classifiers, this system provides precise bounding box coordinates and confidence scores, offering a transparent "second opinion" for medical professionals.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Data Engineering & Preprocessing

### 1. Handling Raw DICOM Data
The project utilized the **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge** dataset. The raw medical images were in **DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)** format, which is standard for hospitals but incompatible with most rapid-training AI pipelines.

* **Challenge:** DICOM files contain complex metadata and high-bit-depth pixel arrays.
* **Solution:** I engineered a preprocessing pipeline using `pydicom` and `OpenCV` to extract the pixel data, normalize it, and convert thousands of images into high-quality **PNG** format.

### 2. Creating a Balanced Dataset (The 500/500 Split)
To prevent the model from becoming biased (e.g., guessing "Healthy" every time because most people are healthy), I curated a strictly balanced training set.

* **Positive Cases (500+):** Images confirmed to have pneumonia opacities.
* **Negative Cases (500-):** Images confirmed as "Normal" or "No Lung Opacity / Not Pneumonia".
* **Label Linking:** I mapped the RSNA CSV clinical labels to standard YOLO `.txt` annotation files, ensuring every image was perfectly linked to its ground-truth bounding box.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Model Training (YOLOv5)

With the data prepared, I configured a custom **YOLOv5s (Small)** architecture, chosen for its balance of inference speed and detection accuracy—critical for clinical settings.

* **Configuration:** 50 Epochs, Batch Size 8.
* **Environment:** Trained on a local GPU environment (`rpnem`).
* **Outcome:** The training process optimized the weights over 50 iterations, saving the model with the highest Mean Average Precision (mAP) as `best.pt`.

### Training Metrics
The model's performance was tracked using loss curves and validation metrics to ensure it wasn't overfitting to the training data.

## 💻 Phase 3: The Clinical Web Application (CDSS)

The final deliverable is a **Streamlit** web application that serves the model to end-users. This interface turns the raw code into a usable medical product.

### 1. The Inference Interface
Radiologists can upload standard PNG/JPG X-rays. The system runs inference in milliseconds (using `@st.cache_resource`) and renders red bounding boxes around suspected pneumonia regions.

### 2. Clinical Analysis & Reporting
Beyond just visuals, the app generates a detailed **Clinical Report**.
* **Confidence Thresholding:** A dynamic slider (0.10 - 1.0) allows doctors to adjust sensitivity.

* **Data Table:** Displays exact spatial coordinates (`xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`) for every detection.
* **Export:** Findings can be downloaded as a CSV for integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR).
